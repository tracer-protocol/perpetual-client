## Status

This client is still in development. It serves as an interface to the tracer-protocol contracts, allowing users to long/short assets view their positions and provide insurance to the protocol to earn yield.

## Stable Branches

-   master

-   develop

## Todos

-   Remove most of tailwind css, as the dapp grew I began to like it less and less, I wouldnt be opposed to moving away from this in place of styled components or another inline css. Reasoning being longer term, I dont see tailwind flopping, its more of a matter of inter-compatibility.
-   Build starter script to make it easier to get started
-   Remove old story book stuff or create story books for more components (the development of these slowed down as we had some drastic changes)
-   Setup testing (doesnt have to be all ui testing there is a fair bit of logic)

## Setup

In order to get the full Dapp running locally you will need to run a number of things. If you want to get started straight away, you should be able to start the app and switch to kovan. Kovan will have a running instance of everything you need. The only thing to note is that the OME_BASE_URL does not change between networks so that will need to be updated in the .env file if you wish to view the orderbook.

A complete list of the required tooling is as follows

-   a local running instance of [the graph](https://thegraph.com/) with the deployed [subgraph](https://github.com/lions-mane/tracer-graphs).
-   the [executioner](https://github.com/tracer-protocol/executioner)
-   the [tracer-ome](https://github.com/tracer-protocol/tracer-ome)
-   a development rpc such as [ganache-cli](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-cli)
-   deployed [tracer-contracts](https://github.com/tracer-protocol/tracer-protocol) to the above network

### Testnet Details

-   [Subgraph](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph/tracer-protocol/tracer-kovan)
-   [OME](https://order.tracer.finance)

### Environment Variables

Create a .env.local in your root directory and set the following variables

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_TRADER_ADDRESS="address from truffle migrate"
NEXT_PUBLIC_GRAPH_URI=http://localhost:8000/subgraphs/name/{your-local-name}/{your-deployed-graph-name}
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8989
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEPLOYMENT=DEVELOPMENT

```

If you are not making changes to the graph or the OME, you can run off the deployed testing versions by setting the following. These variables can also be found in /context/Web3Config and can be accessed without setting the below variables and just switching to Kovan testnet in your browser. If you set the below variables you will be able to access data without switching to Kovan testnet.

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_TRADER_ADDRESS="0x98D801b0cB3576c048CB74e095187DF5E7025D61"
NEXT_PUBLIC_GRAPH_URI=https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/tracer-protocol/tracer-kovan
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.tracer.finance
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEPLOYMENT=DEVELOPMENT
```

## Quickstart Guide

This may not be that helpful but for now I am just going to list everything I do to get started. This could all be wrapped in a nice script. Previous scripts I ran can be found [here](https://github.com/lions-mane/tracer-workspace/blob/master/get-contract-addresses.js) and [here](https://github.com/lions-mane/tracer-workspace/blob/master/deploy-contracts.sh). They are pretty basic but they helped a little.

-   start local graph-node with docker-compose up. The graph to get started can be found [here](https://thegraph.com/docs/).
-   start local rpc with ganache-cli with
    `ganache-cli --mnemonic \"mnemonic\" --port 8545 --gasLimit=0x1fffffffffffff --host 0.0.0.0"`
-   deploy contracts
-   copy trader address into executioner .env file
-   start the [executioner](https://github.com/tracer-protocol/executioner)
-   start the [tracer-ome](https://github.com/tracer-protocol/tracer-ome)
-   copy factory address into the [tracer-graphs](https://github.com/lions-mane/tracer-graphs) /config/tracer-local.json (do not worry about the other addresses)
-   run a few scripts [tracer-graphs](https://github.com/lions-mane/tracer-graphs)
    -   `npm run prepare:tracer:local || yarn prepare:tracer:local`
    -   `npm run create:tracer:local || yarn create:tracer:local`
    -   `npm run deploy:tracer:local || yarn deploy:tracer:local`

## Running

Occasionally npm struggles with the depending pinning so try yarn if you cannot seem to get the install working.

`npm install` or `yarn` then
`npm run dev` or `yarn dev`
